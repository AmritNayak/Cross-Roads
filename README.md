# Cross-Roads
Minor project for Codex ITER

Cross Roads is a game implemented in python using turtle graphics

## How to play the game ?

* A turtle moves forwards when you press (NOT hold) the "Up" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.

* Cars are randomly generated and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.

* When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the initial position and the player levels up. Upon each level up, the cars' speed increases.

* When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.
